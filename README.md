# SLERF-Samples
This repo includes coding samples in Stata, R, and Python 


## Program: Python
**File**: ‘DylanEldred_python_sample.py’


**Background**: This sample is from my final project for Syracuse University’s introductory Python course, ‘Introduction to Application Programming.’ Students were tasked with completing a project of their choosing. I came up with the idea and completed this project independently. The goal was to create an interactive widget that would display nearby COVID vaccine providers. The API that fills in provider location data is no longer active, but running the program will still return a choropleth map of vaccination rates by U.S state and a map displaying the user’s input address. 

**Highlights**:
-	Pandas Manipulation
-	API Handling
-	Geographic Data Visualization
-	Looping


## Program: Stata
**Files**: ‘DylanEldred_stata_sample.do’, ‘DylanEldred_stata_sample_log’,‘cps_occ_safety.dat’, ‘total_emp’ 

**Background**: I was selected to participate in the Syracuse University Economics Distinction Program. I completed an independent research project from start to finish. These files cover my analysis of health insurance reform on insurance coverage for workers in risky occupations. My data comes from the March Supplement of the Current Population Survey. This study was inspired by Kosali Simon’s paper ‘Adverse Selection in Health Insurance Markets? Evidence from State Small-Group Health Insurance Reforms’(2005).

**Highlights**:
-	Data Cleaning
-	Merging Datasets
-	Fixed Effects Regression
-	Probit Regression


## Program: R

**File:** ‘DylanEldred_R_sample.r’, ‘insurance.csv ‘

**Background:** I prepared this sample independently to briefly showcase my familiarity with data manipulation and regression functions in R. ‘insurance.csv’ comes from Brett Lantz’ ‘Machine Learning with R’. 


**Highlights:**
-	Importing and manipulating data sets
-	Basic Visualizations 
-	Simple Linear Regression
